Autumn floor (2017-8), for flute and electronics.
Chão de Outono was created in collaboration with flutist Valentina Daldegan. The piece is based on the homonymous poem by Mario Quintana and seeks, through the poetic text, to explore the boundaries between speech and flute. The sound of the poem's recitation was the starting point for the definition of aspects such as articulation, rhythm and melodic contour, while its semantic universe brought to light images, spatiality and characters that are present in the piece.
